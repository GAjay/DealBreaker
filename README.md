# DealBreaker
Android Dating App using Firebase API

A dating app that allows each user to cut through the time needed to find a potential significant other's dealbreaker.

By only allowing users to view a potential matches' biography, location, and self-defined bad attributes.

Meaning that until both user's confirm interest in each other they are unaware of what good attributes each user
may list for themselves allowing for people to instead of weigh the good and bad they have to decide if the potential
dealbreakers outweight the potential relationship.
